## Overview

R tools to fetch and visualize [NOAA's][noaa] Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset ([NClimGrid][nclimgrid]): 

> The NOAA Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid) consists of four climate variables derived from the GHCN-D dataset: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature and precipitation. Each file provides monthly values in a 5x5 lat/lon grid for the Continental United States. Data is available from 1895 to the present.

Basic functions include:

* `get_nclimgrid_monthly()` Downloads and formats nClimGrid monthly data for recent years
* `get_nclimgrid_normals()` Downloads and formats nClimGrid normals data for ranges of period of record
* `compute_anomaly()` Computes the difference between two datasets of the same measurement type

Some plotting functions are included to visualize measurements and anomalies:

* `plot_nclimgrid()` Creates a monthly faceted plot of measurement (either monthly or normals) or anomaly
* `plot_nclimgrid_histogram()` Creates a histogram (if evaluating one dataset) or mirrored histogram (if comparing two datasets)

This package is not created or maintained by NOAA. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Development version from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("toozler/noaa_nclimgrid_r")
```

## Usage

### Fetching and manipulating data

[NOAA][noaa] stores the nClimGrid dataset in yearly files containing all months (up to previous month for the current year). The `get_nclimgrid_*()` functions fetch this data and perform some basic parsing:

```{r example1}
nclim_monthly_data <- get_nclimgrid_monthly(year = 2023, 
                                            measurement = "tave", 
                                            region = "us", 
                                            wide = FALSE, 
                                            verbose = FALSE)
nclim_monthly_data %>% str
```

The example above pulls average temperature (`tave`) for the Continental US (`us`) in 2023. Available datasets include also `tmin` (minimum temperatures), `tmax` (maximum temperatures) and `prcp` (precipitation). More details about the nClimGrid dataset are available [here][nclimgrid]. As default, the data frame is converted to a long format for easier integration with [tidyverse][tidyverse] packages. Metadata is stored in each data frame as attributes.

```{r example2}
nclim_normals_data <- get_nclimgrid_normals(period = "1901-2000", 
                                            measurement = "tave", 
                                            region = "us")
```

The above example will pull the normals (typical values) for a given set of available periods of record. By default, "1901-2000" (20th Century) is used. Other available periods can be listed with `validate_normals_period()`

Same measurement type datasets (i.e. temperature or precipitation) can be compared by using the `compute_anomaly()` function, which returns the difference between the two datasets. Months not present on the LHS are not included (i.e. your monthly measurements only cover a few months of the year). 

```{r example3}
tave_anomaly <- compute_anomaly(nclimgrid_data_a = nclim_monthly_data, 
                                nclimgrid_data_b = nclim_normals_data)

tave_anomaly %>% str
```

  
### Visualization

You can visualize nClimGrid data with `plot_nclimgrid()`. The month column is automatically faceted as only one month can be displayed per each map. Values are automatically labelled with the month's name. A default title and subtitle (where applicable) is generated based on the data being plotted.

```{r examplegraph1, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE}
nclim_monthly_data %>% 
  filter(month %in% 2:3) %>% 
  plot_nclimgrid(facet_cols = 1, 
                 show_credit = T)
```

Anomalies can be visualized by plotting the output of `compute_anomaly()`. 

```{r examplegraph2, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
temperature_anomaly <- compute_anomaly(nclim_monthly_data, 
                                       nclim_normals_data)

temperature_anomaly %>% 
  filter(month %in% 1:4) %>% 
  plot_nclimgrid(facet_col = 2)

```

The output of the plotting function is a `ggplot2` object, which allows you tack on additional `geoms` (i.e. to add features like points and labels), to remove features (i.e. remove titles and facet labels) or to modify features (i.e. theme options):

```{r examplegraph3, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE}
require(maps)
require(ggrepel)

nclim_monthly_prcp_data <- get_nclimgrid_monthly(year = 2023, 
                                                 measurement = "prcp", 
                                                 region = "us")
large_us_capitals <- maps::us.cities %>% 
  filter(capital != 0, pop >= 400000) %>% 
  mutate(name = gsub(" ", ", ", name))

nclim_monthly_prcp_data %>%
  filter(month %in% 7) %>%
  plot_nclimgrid(show_credit = F, show_states = F) +
  geom_point(data = large_us_capitals, aes(x=long, y=lat)) +
  geom_label_repel(data = large_us_capitals, aes(x=long, y=lat, label=name),
                    box.padding = 1, segment.alpha = 0.5, size = 2.5) +
  labs(title = NULL, 
       subtitle = NULL) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none', 
        strip.text = element_blank())
  
```

You can visualize and compare the distribution of values from monthly, normals or anomaly datasets with `plot_nclimgrid_histogram()`. 

```{r examplegraph4, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}
plot_nclimgrid_histogram(nclimgrid_data_a = nclim_monthly_data %>% filter(month %in% 1:6),
                         nclimgrid_data_b = nclim_normals_data %>% filter(month %in% 1:6),
                         facet_cols = 2)
```

## Future features

* Subset data by state or region
* Fetch data from nClimGrid's [archive][nclimgridarchive] of monthly data from 1895 onwards.
* Option to compute anomaly also as a percentage
* Function to compute ranks based on normal percentiles - this dataset is not readily available at NCIS.
